  "texthistoria": "Created by Jean Minchelli at the end of the 1960s, a man of the sea and a friend of all Paris in vogue, Le Duc was part of the New Culinary Wave that was to sweep across France: breaking with the dogmas of traditional and bourgeois cuisine , the restaurant dares to use natural simplicity, reducing the quantity of sauces and cooking time to gain flavor and lightness. It is here that the first fish served raw appeared, unheard of then! This very modern kitchen ensures the Duke longevity and modernity. Signed Slavik, the original decor tinged with sea spray anchors the place in a timeless chic",

  "textproductos": "Since its creation, quality and freshness have been the watchwords of this high-class establishment. Fish, shellfish and crustaceans come from the French coasts, taken out of the water by small fishermen. The menu follows the tides and the seasons, to deliver only the best arrivals: Breton lobster, Belon oysters or line-caught sea bass are highlighted by the simplicity of the preparations and the accuracy of the cooking. As for spices and aromatic herbs, they know how to reveal the true nature of these unique products, whether they are luxurious like turbot or popular like sardines.",
  "equipo": "Team",
  "textequipo": "The teams follow one another at Le Duc but the Minchelli spirit is still there. Dominique Minchelli assisted by Pascal HÃ©lard and Senthuran Vignesvaran in the kitchen ensures that family spirit and modernity go hand in hand. The room team is present at the meeting and takes care of all customers with the same attention, whether old regulars or future ones."
